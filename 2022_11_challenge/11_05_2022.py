        """LeetCode 212

        What a journey. I have solved this problem before by myself, but the
        same method back then no longer worked today, because the test cases
        had been enlarged. This means the method must be even more optimized.

        I was not able to figure out the optimized method, so I took a look at
        various comments. It turns out the trick is at trimming the trie on the
        words that have already been identified. This prevents duplication in
        the result and avoids traversing the same path that has been done before.

        The mechanism used for trimming is to keep a 'count' of the number of
        times a node has been passed through during the creation of the trie.

        Then, each time a word has been found, we go through the same path and
        decrement the count. This way, when all the words that go through a node
        have been found, that node's count would decrement to 0. We don't have
        to traverse that node anymore.

        With trimming, I was able to pass OC. 4136 ms, faster than 32.07%

        But I am too lazy right now to figure out the time complexity.
