        Since the largest n is 8, which means the longest parenthesis string
        is 16 element long, we can iterate through all possible parenthesis
        arrangement and check which ones are valid. The max number of check is
        2^16 = 1024 times, which is very reasonable.

        The check is easily done via a stack.

        There is one trick on iterating through all possible parenthesis states.
        Since we designate 0 => ( and 1 => ), then the state cannot start with
        1 and cannot end with 0. Therefore, we only have to iterate 2^(N - 1)
        number of states, and each state must be an odd number. This shrinks our
        search space, and leads to the following runtime.

        """I wasn't able to come up with a recursion solution, probably because
        my brain is tired. Anyway, this is the official recursion solution. The
        key observation is that at each step we can add a '(' or  ')'. After
        that, we have the same subproblem which can also be solved by adding
        either a '(' or ')'. However, we can make better decisions as to when
        the '(' or ')' is used. The solution constrants that we can only add a
        '(' when the total number of '(' is â‰¤ n. And we can only add a ')'
        when the current number of right parenthesis is smaller or equal to the
        left. We cannot have a larger value in right compared to left. With
        these restrictions, the recursion relation is fairly easy to write.
